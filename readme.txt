== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this approach work? =

Absolutely! As search engines crawl, they score webpages in terms of how comprehensively they cover certain topics. As you create content and mention more relevant topics, you boost your authority score for that topic, which results in a higher search rank and, in turn, more organic traffic.

= Is this keyword spamming? =

It shouldn't be! Our engine suggests related keywords. At that point, it's up to you to figure out how you want to use that data in your content. We suggest that you use this keyword data to write more relevant, interesting content -- please don't spam!

= How can I get more keywords? =

Just mozy on down to our website at http://MarketMuse.co for a more feature-rich version of this same tool. There, you can get more keyword suggestions and get more specific data on your relevant keywords.
