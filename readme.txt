Suggests keywords relevant to the topic of your blog post. Adding relevant keywords to your post generates more organic traffic.


== Description ==

'Related keywords' are keywords that are topically-related to your primary keywords. By adding in related keywords into your content, you'll boost organic search traffic.

Topical relevance has recently become critical, since Google Hummingbird (2013) and Panda 4.0 (2014) updates are mostly focused on analyzing topical relevance within content. In other words, using more related keywords in your content boosts Topical Authority and ranks your content higher in Google search.

The MarketMuse Relevant Keywords tool helps you check for related keywords that you may have missed. As you add related keywords to your content, you'll improve the quality of your post and your post will generate more organic traffic.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can this actually help me generate more traffic? =

Absolutely! Search engines score webpages in terms of how comprehensively your post covers the topic you're writing about. As you use more relevant keywords in your content, you boost your Topical Authority score, which results in a higher search rank and more traffic.

= Is this keyword spamming? =

It shouldn't be! Our engine suggests related keywords. At that point, it's up to you to figure out how you want to use that data in your content. If you use a keyword too often, our sidebar will actually alert you. We don't encourage keyword spamming as it can hurt your traffic.
